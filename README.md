# ABHINAW-MATRIX
We propose a novel evaluation matrix for assessing text and typography in AI-generated images, addressing gaps in current benchmarking methods like CLIP SCORE and T2I-CompBench++. Our matrix uses automated tools for reproducible benchmarks, setting a new standard in text accuracy evaluation for AI image synthesis platforms.
